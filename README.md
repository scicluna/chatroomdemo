  # Void Chat

  ## Description

  Void Chat is a custom-built chat application that facilitates real-time communication between users, utilizing Google and GitHub authentication for seamless and secure access. This project marked my initial experience with OAuth authentication, web sockets, and the intricacies of client-server interactions during deployment. By employing TypeScript for the backend and a React/TypeScript combination for the frontend, I successfully created a cohesive and interactive chat room as a demonstrative showcase.
